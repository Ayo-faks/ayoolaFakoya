##### <span>01.</span> About me

Passionate AI/ML Developer experienced in NLP and Generative AI models. Skilled in cloud engineering and data science with a focus on Python. I also channel my creativity into music production, songwriting, and filmmaking during my spare time. Love exploring the intersection of technology and art to create innovative solutions. Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects!

##### <span>02.</span> Interests and Hobbies

My interests and hobbies offer a glimpse into my diverse passions. I find immense joy in playing the piano, losing myself in the enchanting world of music as my fingers dance across the keys. As a soccer enthusiast, I eagerly follow the sport, cheering for my favorite teams, and immersing myself in the thrill of each match. Beyond that, I have a deep curiosity about alternative realities, whether I'm delving into thought-provoking books, mind-bending movies, or immersive virtual experiences. Lastly, I cherish the serene beauty of the beach – the sound of waves, the warm sand beneath my feet – it's a place where I can truly unwind and recharge

##### <span>03.</span> Framework Preferences

I leverage a versatile toolkit of Python, Langchain, and Vector databases to engineer data-driven solutions. With my proficiency in Next.js and JavaScript, I craft dynamic and interactive web applications. For machine learning and deep learning, I harness the power of PyTorch, while cloud deployment and infrastructure are expertly handled using AWS, Azure, and GCP. My comprehensive set of tools and frameworks empowers me to tackle a wide range of projects with efficiency and innovation
